## Where I started
Nothing surprising, ```Printf("Hello World)``` is the first code that guid me into the world of 
the computer science. Even though _Python_ is the first language I learned, _C++_ is my favouritest
language and the one I use the most!

## The Language I use

## What I Believe
> No pain No gain!

I believe most people what to live in a comfortable way. However, life will never act the way we want. It is a fair trade-off. The more effort we show, the more we can get. 

## The Most Important Things For Me
1. Sleep
2. Eat 
3. Study
4. Cat!!!!!!([It is my cat!](WechatIMG251.jpeg))
